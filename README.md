## Development guide

For any contribution, as well as for any user, to understand the versioning tags one has to know has the flow being thought.

The base is the [GitHubFlow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (much simpler than [GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html)) and for that it has been setup the [bumpversion](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion).

See the guide for the [versioning](https://github.com/srgblnch/skippy/wiki/versioning-rules).
